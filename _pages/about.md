I am a Ph.D. candidate in the School of Information Engineering, Chang'an University, majoring in Transportation Information Engineering and Control. I will enroll in September 2024. Prior to that, I pursued my undergraduate studies at Chang'an University from 2018 to 2022 and was granted the privilege of pursuing graduate studies with an exemption from the entrance examination due to my outstanding academic performance, ultimately staying at the same university for my master's degree. Between 2022 and 2024, I studied for my master's degree at Chang'an University and was accepted into the direct Ph.D. program, becoming a doctoral student of Chang'an University. My research focuses on dynamic timing optimization for signal control at smart intersections, under the supervision of Professor Zhao Xiangmo.

Research experience

Project Title: Automated Road Detection and Digital Twin (Key University-Level Project Initiation to Completion)
Project Time: October 2022 - October 2023

Project Description: This project leveraged the C++ programming language to design and implement a multi-threaded automated road defect collection vehicle. By integrating advanced algorithms with deep learning networks, it successfully achieved the visualization of road modeling and further developed an interactive road information management system.

My Key Responsibilities:

(1) Designed and developed the upper computer software using C++. Utilized multi-threading to simultaneously control three area scan cameras for road data acquisition. Synchronized with the system's timestamp, the laser generator was triggered to merge overlapping data segments, resulting in effective road detection data.

(2) Employed neural network models to recognize and label the data. Constructed a digital twin of the road through digitalization, and developed an interactive management system to regularly monitor road conditions.

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
