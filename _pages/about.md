I am a Ph.D. candidate in the School of Information Engineering, Chang'an University, majoring in Transportation Information Engineering and Control. I enrolled in September 2024. Prior to that, I pursued my undergraduate studies at Chang'an University from 2018 to 2022 and was granted the privilege of pursuing graduate studies with an exemption from the entrance examination due to my outstanding academic performance, ultimately staying at the same university for my master's degree. Between 2022 and 2024, I studied for my master's degree at Chang'an University and was accepted into the direct Ph.D. program, becoming a doctoral student of Chang'an University. My research focuses on dynamic timing optimization for signal control at smart intersections, under the supervision of Professor Zhao Xiangmo.
